# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: October 31, 2018

**Objective:** Get the freecodecamp Responsive web design certificate and JavaScript algorithms and data structures certificate.

**Me so far as a web developer:** Little about html, css, javascript. Started freecodecamp a couple of months ago. But right now I am taking a bootstrap 4 course.
